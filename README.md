- 👋 Hi, I’m Emily.
- 👀 I’m interested in creating websites for local small businesses, preferably women-owned/led.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Wordpress, Java, IT automation with Python, Digitial Marketing/E-Commerce, Data Analytics with R and Computer Science with C and Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will increase my skills and marketability for creating websites. Especially React apps and HTML/CSS.
- 📫 How to reach me: my awesome business site: https://www.websitedesignthatshines.com (Yes, I know it's a Wordpress site, but I needed to get it done!)
